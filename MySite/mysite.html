				Well hello there, welcome to my webpage. If you're looking for Brandon then you've come to the right place. <br/><br/>
				First, a bit about me. I was born and raised in Alberta, growing up in a small town you learn how to keep yourself occupied, so I was always looking for something to do to prevent boredom from setting in. I like to keep myself busy, always improving  After high school I became more accustomed to the city, navigating campus and the interesting events that take place nearby. Eventually when I'm done with my degree I would like to venture elsewhere around the world, an experience things that I would not be able to experience in Alberta or even Canada.

		<h1>Education</h1>

				I am an aspiring computer scientist currently studying at the University of Alberta. My hope if to make a meaningful impact in the world of technology, and better the lives of many people. Currently I am in my last semester and am looking forward to my graduation. I started my post-secondary in 2011, at the time I was a Biology student and looking forward to learning and understanding many of the life forms that inhabit our planet. After 2 years though I felt unsatisfied with my education and started looking for other fields to study. I eventually had the idea to take a Computing Science course as an elective, it turned out to be the course that would convince me that the field of computing was worth investing in. The unique methods of problem solving and the satisfaction of building something were far greater than memorzing facts from a textbook.

				As a recent graduate I will be looking to make a meaningful impact in the world of technology, whether it be in a start-up or with a respected company. I like to think that my ability to communicate well and work well with a variety of personalities is an asset and something that I am proud of. I take a lot of pride in my work and that effects my work ethic in a very positive way.
